## ChatBot: Conversational AI with TensorFlow and NLTK

This is a simple chatbot implemented in Python using TensorFlow, TFLearn, and NLTK. The chatbot is designed to understand user inputs, classify them into predefined categories (intents), and provide appropriate responses. The project showcases the fundamental concepts of machine learning, such as data preprocessing, neural network training, and natural language processing.

# Features
	•	Natural Language Understanding:
	•	Tokenizes input using NLTK.
	•	Stems words to reduce variability in inputs (e.g., “running” → “run”).
	•	Custom Intent Recognition:
	•	Define intents and responses in a JSON file.
	•	Uses a bag-of-words model for intent classification.
	•	Machine Learning:
	•	Neural network powered by TensorFlow and TFLearn.
	•	Model training and saving for future reuse.
	•	Interactive Chat:
	•	Real-time conversation loop with the chatbot.

# How It Works
	1.	Intent File: Define user intents, patterns, and responses in intents.json. For example:

```bash
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hello", "Hi", "How are you?"],
      "responses": ["Hi there!", "Hello!", "I'm here to help!"]
    }
  ]
}
```

	2.	Preprocessing:
	•	Tokenize user patterns into words.
	•	Stem words to their base form for better generalization.
	•	Convert text data into numerical format using a bag-of-words approach.
	3.	Neural Network:
	•	A simple fully connected neural network classifies user inputs.
	•	Outputs probabilities for each intent.
	4.	Interactive Chat:
	•	Based on the highest intent probability, the chatbot selects a response from the corresponding intent.

# Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot.git
```

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd chatbot
```

	3.	Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Dependencies include:
	•	tensorflow
	•	tflearn
	•	nltk
	•	numpy

	4.	Download the NLTK tokenizer:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

Usage
	1.	Prepare your intents:
	•	Edit the intents.json file to define custom patterns, tags, and responses.
	2.	Train the model (first run):
	•	The chatbot will preprocess the data and train the neural network.
	•	The model is saved as model.tflearn for reuse.
	3.	Start the chatbot:
```bash
python chatbot.py
```

	4.	Chat with the bot:
	•	Enter text, and the bot will respond based on trained intents.
	•	Type quit to exit.

# File Structure
	•	chatbot.py: Main chatbot script.
	•	intents.json: File containing intents, patterns, and responses.
	•	data.pickle: Pickled file for preprocessed data (words, labels, training, output).
	•	model.tflearn: Saved model file after training.

# Customization
	1.	Add Intents:
	•	Expand or modify the intents.json file to include new tags, patterns, and responses.
	2.	Adjust Neural Network:
	•	Change the number of hidden layers or neurons in the build_model method to improve performance.
	3.	Training Parameters:
	•	Modify n_epoch, batch_size, or other training parameters in the load_or_train_model method.

# Example Conversation

Hello, I'm a bot. Start chatting with me (To terminate chatbot, type: 'quit')
You: Hi
Bot: Hi there!
You: What's your name?
Bot: I'm here to help! What can I do for you?

# Future Improvements
	•	Add support for dynamic intents without retraining the model.
	•	Integrate with external APIs for more advanced functionality.
	•	Improve the neural network by adding features like LSTMs or attention mechanisms.
